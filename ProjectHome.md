TestRR is a very lightweight framework that can be used to test robustness and performance for Java applications. It is based on  the work done during the development of [Aloha](https://trac.osmosoft.com/Aloha) and is described in [this paper](http://submissions.agile2008.org/node/1929) at Agile2008.
Two sample scenarios are also provided if you check out the source code. While the samples use [Spring](http://springframework.org) to run the robustness scenarios, the unit tests demonstrate how the application can be  run with plain Java code.

Currently, the statistics provided at the end of the run are quite minimal. More statistics can easily be added to the project as and when required.
